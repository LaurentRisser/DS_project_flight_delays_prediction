## Predicting flight delays in the U.S.
### Project Type: Data Analysis and Machine Learning

In this project, I develop a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-off. I comment on the importance of the separation of the dataset during the training stage and how cross-validation helps determine accurate model parameters. I show how to build linear and polynomial models for univariate or multivariate regressions.
