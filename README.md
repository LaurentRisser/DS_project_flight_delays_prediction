In this project, I develop a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-off. Among then, I comment on the importance of the separation of the dataset during the traning stage and how cross-validation helps in determing accurate model parameters. I show how to build linear and polynomial models for univariate or multivariate regressions and also, I give some insight on the reason why regularisation helps us in developing models that generalize well.
